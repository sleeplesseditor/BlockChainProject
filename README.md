# BlockchainProject

This is a simple blockchain and cryptocurrency experiment, built in Node.js and using guidance from David Katz's course on Udemy, and his sf-chain project.

The app uses Jest as a testing suite, CryptoJS for the SHA256 algorithm, and Websocket to build a peer-to-peer server.

The app is still a work in progress, and the Wallet function has yet to be added, but will be updated soon!
