# BlockchainProject

This is a simple blockchain and cryptocurrency experiment, built in Node.js and using guidance from David Katz's course on Udemy, and his sf-chain project.

The app uses Jest as a testing suite, CryptoJS for the SHA256 algorithm, Elliptic for cryptographic purposes, UUID for unique ID creation for objects, and Websocket to build a peer-to-peer server. The get and post responses were tested with Postman.

Potential further developments could include front-end components.

Next feature to be added: mining transactions in the block.
